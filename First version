Not only is a universal, single-payer system the right and most economically feasible policy, it’s also clearly more popular among Americans than the current system.

According to a November 2020 Fox News poll, 72 percent of voters favor a universal, government-administered health care plan.
A CNN exit poll of N.C. voters in the 2020 Democratic primary found majority support for replacing private insurance with a “government” plan.
Overall, Republicans and Democrats have tended to favor Medicare For All with consistency.

The COVID-19 pandemic has made the need for a healthcare system that values people over profits more urgent than ever before. Therefore, we the undersigned urge the Biden administration to support passage of Medicare For All.  We urge the entire N.C. Congressional delegation to sign on as co-sponsors of the new bills - H.R. 1976 in the House and the companion bill when introduced in the Senate, so the U.S. may join the rest of the developed world in making healthcare a human right and not a privilege.
